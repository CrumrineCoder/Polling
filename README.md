    Best of Personal Blogs. Images and less how-tos and more explorations and stuff for first-timers; sharing of experiences. Tags on not just the technologies, but also how it's used eg. inspiration, resources, code, learning. More of a designer blog than a developer. 

https://css-tricks.com/
    Group for CSS Designers. Much like the above but the article teasers are longer. Because it's mainly about cool CSS stuff, a lot of the teaser images are gifs. 

https://alistapart.com/articles
    Group for Fullstack Designers and Coders; basically everything web. Great topic tag system. Title, author, amount of comments, date, teaser paragraph. 

https://www.pumpkinwebdesign.com/web-design-manchester/blog/
    Group for Web Designers. Date in a unique place alongside the image, the first sentence of the article. Heavy emphasis on the picture. 

https://readspike.com/webdev/
    Aggregation of articles. 

Personal: 

http://esausilva.com/
    Personal website. How tos. Tags and categories. Tutorials. Side bar with lots of info; not personable. Commenting, but no login/register. Searching. No images, lots of text. 
    Title, content. Related articles. About me at the bottom. Links to share this. Comments. 

https://www.lukew.com/ff/
    Personal site. Articles are given by month with just a title and a date. 
    RSS feed. Tags. Videos and images. 

https://www.paulirish.com/
    Personal site. Popular posts. Doesn't shorten articles, just lists them all out. Then he has an archive page for everything. 
	Date. 

https://waitbutwhy.com/
    Personal site that tackles problems, like an advice guru. Newest post is big, and then it's a 2 column grid with a picture and title and two line sentence for the rest. 

https://www.zachleat.com/web/
    Personal site that deals with problems. Fixed sidebar. 

https://www.bramstein.com/
    Personal site with tabs for home, working, speaking, and writing. 

https://addyosmani.com/
    Personal site with projects on it too. 

https://davidwalsh.name/
    Popular at the top nav. Nice popular topics list. 

https://johnpapa.net/
    Personal site. Articles w/ information, what's being worked on and recent articles on the right. 

http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/
    Personal site with tutorials and thoughts on tech. 

https://paulund.co.uk/
    Dominant search bar. AMAZING types list under the search bar. No date for articles, which I agree with a lot. 

https://una.im/
    Unread tag. No search. 

Notes:
    Using an image each time will probably force me to use irrelevant images and takes more loading time, so I think I'll stick to text-only. It's not about showing a breadth of knowledge, but sharing what I"m working on? I'm not going to be able to cover everything as I'm just one guy.

Title, Content, Path, Optional icon. 

    Create a simple user manager so I can log myself in and keep others from adding things.
Create the simplest article editor, that being simply title, body, date/time ( if you want to get fancy in your 'most basic of blogs', then maybe add a category or even tags! )
Create the simplest list of these articles, just showing the title, linking too...
Create the simplest article view page, showing all the three facts from each blog post you have.
This is where you now start to get a bit fancy now you have your simplest blog in the world, may be add:

SEF (search engine friendly) URLs ( and permalinks )
Search
Archives
RSS Feed

I should have a tutorials section and an update section for stuff I'm working on. I'm also considering a section for other stuff that I'm interested in. 

USER STORIES:

1. I want to be able to go to the blog and instantly know what topics are covered by it.
2. I want to be able to see Nic's progress with apps and explanations through problems he's working with on other applications.
3. I can see Nic's other interests and recent developments therein; eg. tabletop, writing, reading, etc. 
4. I can see what Nic is learning outside of projects he puts on his portfolio
5. I can find areas of interest that I can speak with Nic about should I ever meet him at a Meetup or have an interview with him or want to have him speak somewhere.
5a. I can see Nic's talks and meetups he's attending should I want to know someone at the meetup I'm trying out. 
6. I can talk about the blog articles with Nic and others in the community and point out areas of needed revision or suggestions; writing isn't just about telling information but also about being a part of a community. 
7. If I want to consult with Nic, I can see his workflow and see if it matches ours and get a clear idea of what he'll bring to the culture of the company and whether it's productive. 
8. It acts as essentially a more indexed and larger cover letter and allows people to talk with me more easily without the awkwardness. A documentation of my Web Development process. An answer to the question "So what have you been doing recently?"; show my skills. 

Note: I should avoid trying to become an authority figure because I'm not; I just like learning about this stuff.
